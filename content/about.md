## Summary

I am a **Data Practitioner** specializing in the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from data acquisition and feature engineering to model deployment and visualization. I have proven experience engineering and validating predictive models, achieving high accuracy (e.g., 94% in a time series forecast) to optimize inventory and inform pricing strategies.

I am skilled in developing robust, data-driven solutions, including self-service analytics features for no-code platforms and web crawlers to integrate external data for demand forecasting. As a collaborative problem-solver, I focus on translating complex business requirements into robust technical applications that drive strategic decision-making.

I am eager to apply my skills in Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch), SQL, and cloud platforms (GCP, AWS) to solve complex problems in an innovative, team-oriented environment.
