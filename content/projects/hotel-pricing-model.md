## Project Overview

During my time at **Datawealth**, I developed predictive models to optimize hotel pricing strategies and inventory management.

## Key Outcomes

- **Pricing Model:** Achieved **85% accuracy (15% MAPE)**. This model analyzed historical booking data, seasonality, and competitor pricing to recommend optimal room rates.
- **Inventory Management:** The Proof of Concept (PoC) model achieved **94% accuracy**, helping to predict room demand and prevent overbooking or under-utilization.
- **Impact:** These tools allowed tactical pricing strategies that directly contributed to revenue growth and cost reduction.

## Dashboards & Analytics
Beyond modeling, I engineered self-service analytics dashboards. These tools empowered non-technical stakeholders to independently generate reports and monitor operational performance across various business units.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)**
- **SQL** for data extraction.
- **Visualization Tools** for dashboards.
