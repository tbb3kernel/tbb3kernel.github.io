## Project Overview

This project was developed for the **E-SAN PMU-B Coding & AI Competition**, where my team ("Team Orange Cat") won the **Data Science Track**.

## The Solution
We built a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for real-time demand sensing to help businesses anticipate market fluctuations.

### Methodology
- **Data Integration:** We utilized Python web crawlers and API integrations to fetch diverse open data, including:
    - Weather patterns
    - Demographic shifts
    - Economic indicators
- **Modeling:** We trained an **XGBoost** model to analyze these external factors alongside internal sales data.

## Results
The tool provided actionable insights for strategic planning, allowing businesses to adjust their supply chain and inventory in response to real-time signals.

## Technologies Used
- **XGBoost**
- **Python** (Web Scraping, APIs)
- **Data Engineering Pipelines**
