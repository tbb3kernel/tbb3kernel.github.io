## Project Overview

At **Saifa AI Inc.**, I worked on the core AI engine for the Saifa Application. The goal was to enhance the responsiveness and accuracy of the AI agents.

## Key Contributions

### Agentic AI Workflows
I engineered new workflows that streamlined the decision-making process of the AI agents.
- **Result:** Accelerated inference speed by **30%**.
- **Feature:** Implemented a "thinking process" rendering system, allowing users to see the agent's logic in real-time, improving trust and user experience.

### RAG System Optimization
The existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system faced challenges with precision.
- **Action:** I refined the architecture, focusing on better chunking strategies and retrieval ranking.
- **Result:** Boosted **precision@5 from 76% to 90%**, representing a 14% improvement in retrieval quality.

## Technologies Used
- **LangGraph** for agent workflows.
- **QDrant** for vector storage.
- **Python/FastAPI** for backend services.
